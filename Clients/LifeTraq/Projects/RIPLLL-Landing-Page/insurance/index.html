                    <p>Every unverified wellness activity is a Star Rating risk. RIPLLL provides photo/video proof of medication adherence, preventative screenings, and care plan completion—the exact behaviors CMS measures. Move from 3.5 to 4.0+ stars and protect $15-20M+ in annual quality bonus payments.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Everything you need to know about implementing RIPLLL for your health plan.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <!-- FAQ 1 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does RIPLLL verify wellness activities without violating member privacy?</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL uses simple photo/video proof that members voluntarily submit—medication bottles with timestamps, exercise videos, meal photos, appointment check-ins. Members control what they share. All data is HIPAA-compliant with enterprise-grade encryption, two-factor authentication, and role-based access control. Verification confirms activity completion without exposing sensitive medical details. For example, a photo of a medication bottle confirms adherence without revealing the specific condition being treated.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 2 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between RIPLLL and our current wellness portal?</h3>
                    <p>Your current wellness portal likely relies on self-reported data (members click "I exercised today") or claims-based verification (4-6 week delays). RIPLLL provides real-time photo/video proof of actual completion—closing the 3x gap between self-reported (93%) and verified completion rates (33%). This verified data is what CMS needs for Star Rating measures and what self-funded employers demand for ROI proof. RIPLLL integrates with your existing portal as the verification and engagement layer.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 3 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
                    <p>Most health plans are fully operational within 60-90 days. Implementation includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integration with your EHR, pharmacy, and wellness systems (2-4 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Configuration of Star Rating measures and reward structures (1-2 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Member onboarding and communication campaign (2-4 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Staff training and dashboard setup (1 week)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We provide dedicated implementation support and project management throughout. Pilot programs with 5,000-10,000 members can launch in as little as 30 days.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 4 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if our members aren't tech-savvy (especially Medicare Advantage seniors)?</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL is designed for the "hardest-to-reach" populations—including seniors with limited digital literacy. The interface uses simple photo-based verification (take a picture of your medication, take a picture at the gym) rather than complex form-filling. Voice-guided instructions and large-button design accommodate seniors. Our pilot data shows 75+ year-olds successfully use the platform with minimal support. We also provide member onboarding materials (videos, printed guides, phone support) in multiple languages.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 5 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does RIPLLL improve Star Ratings specifically?</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL directly addresses the HEDIS measures that drive Star Ratings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medication adherence for diabetes, statins, and RAS antagonists (triple-weighted measures accounting for 50% of Star Rating impact)</li>
                        <li>Preventative screenings (mammograms, colonoscopies, diabetic eye exams)</li>
                        <li>Chronic disease management (A1C testing, blood pressure control)</li>
                        <li>Post-acute care plan adherence (reducing 30-day readmissions)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By providing real-time verification and instant rewards, RIPLLL increases completion rates by 15-40%—enough to move most plans from 3.5 to 4.0+ stars.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 6 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the ROI timeline? When will we see results?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Engagement metrics improve immediately (30-60 days):</strong> participation rates, activity completion, member satisfaction scores.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical outcomes appear within 3-6 months:</strong> medication adherence rates, preventative screening completion, ER visit reduction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Star Rating impact shows in the next annual measurement year (12-18 months):</strong> HEDIS measure improvements, quality bonus eligibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Financial ROI is measurable within the first year through:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced ER visits and readmissions ($8-12M savings for 250K member plan)</li>
                        <li>Protected Star Rating bonus revenue ($15-20M for 4.0+ star plan)</li>
                        <li>Improved self-funded employer retention (2-5% revenue protection)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 7 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can RIPLLL integrate with our existing wellness reward vendors (NationsBenefits, NovuHealth, etc.)?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. RIPLLL is designed to enhance—not replace—your existing wellness infrastructure. We integrate with major wellness reward platforms (NationsBenefits Flex Cards, NovuHealth, gift card vendors), EHR systems (Epic, Cerner), pharmacy benefit managers, and population health platforms. RIPLLL becomes the verification and engagement layer that makes your current investments more effective. API-first architecture enables custom integrations with proprietary systems.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 8 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What about fraud? Can members game the system with fake photos?</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL's verification engine includes multiple fraud prevention mechanisms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Timestamp and geolocation verification</li>
                        <li>Photo/video analysis to detect stock images or duplicates</li>
                        <li>Randomized verification requests (members don't know when they'll be asked for proof)</li>
                        <li>Behavioral pattern analysis (flags suspicious activity patterns)</li>
                        <li>Audit trails for every submission</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our fraud detection rate is <2% compared to 15-25% estimated fraud in honor-system programs. The verification layer dramatically reduces fraud risk while maintaining member privacy.</p>
