            <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <!-- FAQ 1 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How is RIPLLL different from self-reporting systems?</h3>
                    <p>Self-reported activity completion creates a 3× gap between claimed and actual completion rates (93% self-reported vs. 33% verified). RIPLLL requires photo/video proof of every activity, eliminating fraud risk and providing audit-ready documentation. This verified data enables defensible ROI claims to CFOs, boards, and regulators.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 2 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What makes RIPLLL's technology "patent-pending"?</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL is built on LifeTraq's patent-pending behavioral verification technology, originally developed for corrections environments. This includes unique gamification algorithms, predictive engagement scoring, and verification workflows specifically designed for high-stakes environments where compliance and outcomes matter.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 3 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How quickly can we see results?</h3>
                    <p>Most partners see measurable improvements within 30-60 days:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insurance: 10-15% increase in verified wellness activity completion</li>
                        <li>HR: 45-day early warning for at-risk new hires (vs. 90-day lag with traditional systems)</li>
                        <li>Coaching: 20-30% reduction in "catch-up time" during coaching sessions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Full ROI typically materializes within 6-12 months through reduced claims, lower turnover, or improved coaching retention.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 4 -->
                <div class="faq-item">

                        <li>Corrections-grade security designed for high-risk environments</li>
                        <li>Audit-ready compliance tracking</li>

                    <p>Every RIPLLL deployment includes:</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can we start with a pilot program before full deployment?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Most partners begin with a pilot program (50-200 participants) to validate ROI before scaling enterprise-wide. Pilot programs typically run 60-90 days and include:</p>

                        <li>Dedicated implementation support</li>
                        <li>Custom reporting to measure pilot outcomes</li>
                        <li>Stakeholder presentations to secure buy-in for full deployment</li>
                        <li>Flexible pricing for pilot-to-production transition</li>
