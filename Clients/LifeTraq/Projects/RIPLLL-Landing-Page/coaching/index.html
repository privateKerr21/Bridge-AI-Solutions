                    <p>Your clients' CFOs demand ROI. Satisfaction surveys don't cut it anymore. RIPLLL provides photo/video proof that executives are actually practicing new leadership behaviors between sessions—verified evidence that protects renewal revenue and justifies premium pricing.</p>
                    <p class="stat">10-15% increase in client retention protects $1-3M+ revenue</p>

                    <h3>Scale Coaching Without Hiring Proportionally</h3>
                    <p>Traditional coaching wastes 20-30% of session time on "What happened since our last call?" RIPLLL eliminates that catch-up time. Coaches review verified behavioral data before sessions, increasing productivity 30-40%. Serve 12-16 executives per coach instead of 8-12.</p>

                    <p>Generic coaching firms compete on price. Transformation partners command premiums. RIPLLL positions you as the latter by closing the loop from assessment to verified behavior change. Charge 15-20% more because you can prove results, not just deliver content.</p>

                    <div class="step-icon">📋🎯</div>
                    <h3>Baseline & Goal Setting</h3>
                    <p>During your initial assessment (Leadership Circle Profile, 360° feedback, or proprietary tool), identify the critical leadership behaviors this executive needs to develop. RIPLLL creates a personalized behavioral tracking plan that integrates seamlessly with your coaching methodology—no generic one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
                    <p class="time-estimate">15 minutes per executive during initial engagement</p>

                    <h3>Between-Sessions Verification</h3>
                    <p>Executives use RIPLLL's mobile platform to verify they're actually practicing new behaviors: blocked calendar time for strategic thinking, video reflections on delegation decisions, screenshots of empowering feedback to direct reports. Gamification rewards consistent practice without feeling unprofessional.</p>
                    <p class="time-estimate">2-3 minutes per leadership action</p>

                    <h3>Coach Dashboard & Data-Driven Sessions</h3>
                    <p>Before each coaching call, review verified behavioral data in your dashboard. See what executives actually did vs. what they said they'd do. Use that insight to drive deeper, more productive sessions. Generate quantified progress reports perfect for renewal conversations and CFO justification.</p>
                    <p class="time-estimate">5 minutes of pre-session review replaces 20 minutes of catch-up</p>

            <div class="faq-container">
                <!-- FAQ 1 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will RIPLLL work with our existing coaching methodology and assessment tools?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. RIPLLL enhances your existing approach—it doesn't replace it. We work with your team to map your coaching methodology to behavioral tracking categories. Whether you use Leadership Circle Profile, 360° feedback, Hogan Assessments, or proprietary frameworks, RIPLLL integrates seamlessly.</p>
                    <p>Think of it as the behavioral verification layer between your assessment and your executive's actual behavior change. We adapt to your process, not the other way around.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 2 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do you get executives to actually engage with the platform?</h3>
                    <p>Great question. We've piloted RIPLLL with Fortune 500 executives and seen 75-85% consistent engagement. Three reasons it works:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gamification designed for C-suite:</strong> Professional achievement tracking without feeling juvenile</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimal time investment:</strong> 2-3 minutes per verified action vs. hours of traditional tracking</li>
                        <li><strong>Visible progress:</strong> Executives see their own behavioral improvement quantified, which is intrinsically motivating</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The key is positioning it as accountability technology, not surveillance. High-performers appreciate the structure.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 3 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the implementation timeline?</h3>
                    <p>Most coaching firms are fully operational within 2-3 weeks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Platform setup, coach training, and integration with your assessment tools</li>
                        <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Executive onboarding (we provide turnkey communication templates and video tutorials)</li>
                        <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Active tracking begins; first coaching sessions using verified behavioral data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We handle the heavy lifting. Your coaches get comprehensive training, and we provide white-glove onboarding support for your executive clients.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 4 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the ROI for our coaching practice?</h3>
                    <p>Let's break down the math for a mid-sized firm (50 active executive engagements at $3,000/month average):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Client retention increase:</strong> 10-15% improvement protects $1-3M+ in annual revenue</li>
                        <li><strong>Premium pricing justification:</strong> 15-20% price increases add $2-4M+ annually</li>
                        <li><strong>Coach productivity gains:</strong> 30-40% efficiency increase enables serving more executives per coach (revenue growth without proportional hiring)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Combined impact: $5-20M net annual value for established practices. Cost? Typically $15-20 per executive per month. The math speaks for itself.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 5 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What about privacy and data security? Our clients are C-suite executives.</h3>
                    <p>We built RIPLLL on HIPAA-compliant architecture trusted by government agencies. Security features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two-factor authentication for all users</li>
                        <li>End-to-end encryption for all data transmission and storage</li>
                        <li>Role-based access controls (executives control who sees their data)</li>
                        <li>Annual third-party security audits</li>
                        <li>SOC 2 Type II certification</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your clients' InfoSec teams can review our security documentation during procurement. We meet Fortune 500 security standards.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 6 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you offer white-label or partnership options?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! We have several partnership models:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>White-label branding:</strong> RIPLLL appears as your proprietary coaching platform</li>
                        <li><strong>API integration:</strong> Embed behavioral tracking into your existing coaching technology stack</li>
                        <li><strong>Co-marketing partnerships:</strong> Joint case studies, thought leadership content, conference presentations</li>
                        <li><strong>Revenue share models:</strong> For firms who want to resell RIPLLL as part of their coaching packages</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We're open to creative partnership structures that align with your business model. Let's talk about what makes sense for your practice.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 7 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens if an executive doesn't track consistently?</h3>
                    <p>Inconsistent tracking is valuable data, not a failure. Our dashboard flags low-engagement executives early, enabling proactive intervention. Often, inconsistent tracking reveals real obstacles to behavioral change—workload constraints, misalignment on priorities, or lack of belief in the development goal.</p>
                    <p>That's a coaching conversation worth having in Week 2, not Month 6. RIPLLL's gamification also encourages participation through progress visibility and achievement recognition. Most executives find the platform intrinsically motivating once they see their own improvement quantified.</p>
