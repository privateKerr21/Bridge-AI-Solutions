**Last Updated**: 2026-01-16

## Just Completed
- Discovery call with Matt Williams (transcript captured)
- Strategic AI Roadmap document created identifying 3 workflows
- Proposal landing page (final-proposal.html) delivered
- Identified priority workflow: LinkedIn Outreach & Lead Tracking
- **Built enhanced demo (demo-with-search.html)** with:
  - LinkedIn prospect search simulation (20 mock prospects)
  - 8 data points per prospect (name, email, phone, years, location, company, title, LinkedIn URL)
  - Fit scoring with reasoning
  - Auto-populate to message generator
  - 3 personalized message options per prospect

## Working On Right Now
- Demo ready for Monday presentation
- Preparing for implementation phase

## Blocked/Waiting
- Client confirmation on which workflow to start with
  - **Requested**: Pending
  - **Expected**: TBD

## Next Session Goals
- Get final go-ahead on LinkedIn automation workflow
- Understand current Excel structure and data points being tracked
- Map out the 8 data points Matt wants auto-populated (email, phone, years of service, name, location, etc.)
- Define follow-up cadences (daily, weekly, annual touchpoints)

## Recent Decisions & Rationale
| Decision | Why | Date |
|----------|-----|------|
| Start with LinkedIn workflow | Highest time savings (8-10 hrs/week), both partners need it | Discovery call |
| Keep human in the loop for sending | LinkedIn TOS compliance, compliance requirements | Discovery call |
| Work around CRM, not with it | No API available, SEC audit requirements make it untouchable | Discovery call |

## Open Questions
- What are the exact 8 data points Matt wants extracted from LinkedIn profiles?
- What does the current Excel tracking sheet look like?
- What are the specific follow-up cadences (Day 3, Week 2, Month 6)?
- What messaging templates do they currently use?
- How do they define "cold", "warm", and "qualified" prospects?

## Notes & Observations
- Previously used Hummingbird for LinkedIn automation - expensive with mild results
- Target niche: Oil & gas employees (Marathon Petroleum, HF Sinclair, Chevron)
- 85% of business from oil & gas industry
- Strategy: Introduce to 20 people/day → expect 1 real client/month per person
- Matt values "staying ahead" of AI adoption curve
- Revenue-first mindset: marketing automation first to justify AI investment
