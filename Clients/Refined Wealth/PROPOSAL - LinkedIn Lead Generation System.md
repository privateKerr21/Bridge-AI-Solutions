# LinkedIn Lead Generation System Proposal
## Refined Wealth Management

**Prepared for:** Matt Williams & Kyle
**Prepared by:** Hayden Kerr, Bridge AI Solutions
**Date:** January 19, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Bridge AI Solutions proposes to build a custom AI-powered LinkedIn lead generation system specifically designed for Refined Wealth Management's unique niche in the oil & gas industry. This system will automate the time-consuming manual processes currently consuming 5-6 hours per week per advisor, allowing you and Kyle to focus on high-value client-facing work while maintaining a consistent, scalable outreach strategy.

**Target Outcome:** 2-3 new qualified clients per month total, while preventing prospect leakage and maintaining relationship quality

---

## The Challenge

Currently, Refined Wealth Management faces several operational bottlenecks:

### Shadow Work (10-12 hours/week lost on LinkedIn alone)
- **Manual LinkedIn outreach:** 5-6 hours/week per advisor on 20+ daily introductions tracked in Excel
- **Data extraction burden:** Manually capturing 8+ data points per connection (email, phone, years of service, location, etc.)
- **Follow-up coordination:** "Clunky" Excel-based tracking with no automated reminders
- **Prospect leakage:** "We're probably losing clients based on it" — Matt Williams
- **Mental overhead:** Constant context-switching between "marketing hat" and client service work

### Core Work Neglected
- Proactive client strategy and portfolio optimization
- Deepening existing client relationships
- Strategic business development and thought leadership

### Business Impact
- Known loss of potential clients due to inadequate follow-up systems
- Inability to scale outreach without proportional increase in human overhead
- Marketing tasks competing for attention during peak client service periods

## The Solution: AI-Powered LinkedIn Lead Generation System

### Phase 1: Intelligent Lead Discovery & Data Automation

**What We'll Build:**

1. **Automated Lead Discovery Engine**
   - AI agent trained on your specific targeting criteria:
     - Companies: Marathon Petroleum, HF Sinclair, Chevron (with flexibility to expand)
     - Roles: Employees eligible for financial planning services
     - Geographic focus: National reach with Wasatch Front emphasis
   - Daily scanning and identification of qualified prospects matching your niche
   - Dashboard delivery of 20+ pre-qualified prospects per day (per advisor)

2. **Intelligent Data Extraction & Population**
   - Automatic extraction of 8+ key data points from LinkedIn profiles:
     - Name, email, phone number, current company, location
     - Years of service, job title, connection date
   - Direct population into structured Google Sheets dashboard (or alternative platform)
   - Eliminates manual data entry entirely

3. **Smart Follow-Up Orchestration**
   - Stage-based tracking system (Cold → Warm → Qualified → Client)
   - Automated reminder system based on prospect temperature:
     - **Day 3:** Initial follow-up suggestion with draft message
     - **Week 2:** Check-in prompt with personalized talking points
     - **Month 6:** Re-engagement trigger for dormant prospects
     - **Annual:** Long-term nurture touchpoint
   - Natural language task delivery: "Matt, 5 warm prospects need follow-up this week. Here's the list + suggested messaging."

4. **Human-in-the-Loop Design**
   - AI drafts outreach messages and prepares data
   - **You maintain full control:** Review, edit, and send all communications
   - Compliance-safe: No automated sending to avoid LinkedIn restrictions and maintain regulatory compliance
   - Preserves authentic, human relationship-building while eliminating administrative burden

### Why This Approach Works for Refined Wealth

**Niche Alignment:**
Your 85% concentration in oil & gas (Marathon, Chevron, HF Sinclair) requires precision targeting, not generic outreach. Our system learns your specific prospect profile and replicates your successful search patterns.

**Proven Baseline:**
Your experience with Hummingbird (20 daily introductions = 1+ client/month) provides a proven conversion baseline. Our system maintains this volume while reducing cost and increasing control.

**Compliance-First Architecture:**
- No automated sending (eliminates LinkedIn violation risk)
- Designed to integrate compliance review workflows
- All communications reviewed by you before sending
- Future-ready for compliance document integration

**Scalability Without Overhead:**
- Same system serves both Matt and Kyle simultaneously
- Can expand to additional team members without rebuilding
- Adds revenue-generating capacity without proportional human cost
