## Client: Refined Wealth Management
**Industry**: Financial Services, Wealth Management, RIA
**Engagement Type**: AI Strategy & Automation Implementation
**Primary Contact**: Matt Williams (Financial Advisor / Principal)
**Secondary Contact**: Kyle (Partner/Co-Advisor)

## Client Overview
Refined Wealth Management is a Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) firm based on the Wasatch Front in Utah. They specialize in financial planning and wealth management, with approximately 85% of their business coming from the oil and gas industry—specifically employees of Marathon Petroleum, HF Sinclair, and Chevron. They manage 401(k)s and provide comprehensive financial planning services.

## Pain Points & Goals
- **Manual LinkedIn outreach**: ~20 daily introductions tracked in Excel, highly time-consuming
- **Prospect follow-up breakdown**: Fatigue and data overload cause warm leads to fall through cracks
- **No nurture infrastructure**: No drip campaigns or automated follow-up sequences
- **SEO neglected**: Website (GoDaddy) not driving inbound leads
- **CRM limitations**: Industry-specific RIA CRM with no public API (compliance-focused, SEC audit requirements)

### Goals
- 10+ qualified leads per month
- 2-3 new clients per month
- Reclaim 15-20 hours/week from manual work
- Scale business while maintaining lower human overhead
- Build national brand presence in oil & gas niche

## Project Scope
AI-powered marketing automation starting with:
1. **LinkedIn Outreach Tracker** - Automate activity logging, prospect data extraction
2. **Follow-Up Orchestrator** - Smart sequencing based on prospect stage
3. **Nurture Engine** - Drip campaigns for long-term engagement
4. **SEO Content System** - Automated blog/content generation (future phase)

## Output Standards
- **Proposals**: Visual landing pages with clear value propositions
- **Technical docs**: Clear implementation steps with expected impact
- **Communications**: Professional but approachable tone

## Client Communication Style
- **Revenue-focused**: Justify expense with revenue generation potential
- **Practical**: Want working solutions, not theoretical frameworks
- **Compliance-aware**: SEC audit requirements, data integrity matters
- **Early adopter mindset**: Wants to get ahead of AI curve, not play catch-up

## Guardrails
- LinkedIn automation must respect platform TOS (draft only, human sends)
- CRM has no API - work around it, don't promise integration
- Compliance-sensitive industry - all communications need human review
- Proprietary client information must remain confidential

## Key Context
- Previously used Hummingbird for LinkedIn automation (expensive, mild results)
- Excel is current tracking system (feels "clunky" but functional)
- Both Matt and Kyle would run LinkedIn outreach strategy
- Target: Oil & gas industry employees (Marathon, HF Sinclair, Chevron)
- Niche focus: Retirement planning, 401(k) management
