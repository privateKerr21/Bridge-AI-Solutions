# Clients - INDEX

## Quick Links
- [Client Template](./_Template/) - Copy this for each new client

## Purpose
This directory contains all client-specific folders. Each client has their own dedicated space with projects, communications, deliverables, and knowledge sources.

## How to Add a New Client
1. Copy the `_Template` folder
2. Rename it to the client's name (e.g., `Acme Corp`)
3. Fill out the `CLAUDE.md` file with client details
4. Start organizing materials in the appropriate subfolders

## Client Folder Structure
Each client folder contains:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Client context and preferences (for AI)
- `Projects/` - Individual project work
- `Communications/` - Meeting notes, emails, key correspondence
- `Deliverables/` - Final outputs delivered to client
- `Knowledge Sources/` - Client-provided documents and research
- `Assets/` - Client logos, brand materials
